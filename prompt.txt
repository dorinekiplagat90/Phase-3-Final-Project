FIRST PROMPT 
does this code support crud


Responses 
Yes, this model supports CRUD, but it does not implement CRUD by itself.
What’s missing
Your code does not include:
A database session


CRUD methods or queries


Commit / rollback logic
SECOND PROMPT
fix the implementation
Here’s a fixed implementation that actually implements CRUD, while keeping things clean and idiomatic.
I’ll show two correct approaches.
 1. Approach 1 is recommended.
 2.Approach 2 works but is less clean.
THIRD PROMPT✅ Features Added / Fixed

    Update and Delete commands for Students and Courses

        Prompts for ID and optional fields

        Checks existence before acting

        Calls model CRUD methods

    List commands for viewing all records

    Proper session handling

        Opens a session at start of each command

        Closes session at the end

    Feedback

        Echoes creation, update, deletion, or errors to the user


Does this model.py support crud
What it does
1. Defines database tables
 2. Defines columns and relationships
 3. Defines object–table mapping
FOURTH PROMPT
Fix the implementation of model.py
fixeThis version keeps everything self-contained: the models can now create, read, update, and delete themselves when given a SQLAlchemy Session.d model.py that actually implements CRUD, not just schema definitions.
FIFTH PROMPT 
Does this code of cli.py support crud
No — the cli.py you shared does not support CRUD.
SIXTH PROMPT
Here’s a fixed and fully functional cli.py implementation that properly integrates your CRUD operations through the CLI commands. The key is wiring the commands so that user input triggers the CRUD methods in your models or repositories.
I’ll assume you already have commands/students.py, commands/courses.py, and commands/enrollments.py with the CRUD logic.
SEVENTH PROMPT 
Fix the implementation of cli.py ,by updating and deleting
